# flutter-imdb

A sample project using the IMDB API

## Getting Started



Command to generate mockito mocks (execute in base project directory)
```shell
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Possibly need these libraries for a native linux app:
```shell
sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev libstdc++-12-dev
sudo apt install libjsoncpp-dev
sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev libjsoncpp-dev libsecret-1-0
```
